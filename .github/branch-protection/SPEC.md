# Branch Protection — noorinalabs-design-system (P3 end-state #4, main#322)

Phase-3 end-state criterion #4 (`noorinalabs-main#322`): **CI failures block all
merges** on every repo's default branch, org-wide — enforced server-side by
GitHub, not only by the Hook 4 comment-gate. This directory carries the
canonical ruleset for this repo's `main`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ruleset-main.json` | The repository ruleset payload (GitHub REST `/rulesets`). |
| `apply-ruleset.sh`  | Owner/admin-gated apply + read-back-verify. Idempotent (create-or-update). |
| `SPEC.md`           | This document — the shape and the why. |

This is design-system's adoption of the parent-canonical spec
(`noorinalabs-main` charter `pull-requests.md` § *Org-Wide Branch Protection +
Admin-Merge Exceptions*), modeled on the W13 live pilot
(`noorinalabs-data-acquisition`, ruleset id `17091263`).

## Application status

The **spec + apply script** land in this PR (W14, `Refs noorinalabs-main#322`).
The actual **apply is owner/admin-gated** and is a **post-merge step**:

1. Creating a repository ruleset requires repo-admin permission, which the agent
   `gh` principal (`parametrization`) does not hold for this purpose.
2. Applying default-branch protection while a wave-branch PR is in flight can
   block our own merges, so the apply runs from a window with **no in-flight
   default-branch merge** — post-wave-wrapup is the safe window.

So #322 is **met for this repo only when the owner has run `apply-ruleset.sh`
and read-back-verified the ruleset on `main`.** `#322` stays OPEN as the
org-wide rollout tracker until all 8 default branches carry the protection.

## The ruleset shape (and why)

A **repository ruleset** targeting `~DEFAULT_BRANCH`, `enforcement: active`:

- **`pull_request` with `required_approving_review_count: 0`** — the load-bearing
  decision. GitHub's "require approvals" counts **formal** GitHub PR reviews,
  which our team structurally cannot produce: the `gh` auth principal IS the PR
  author (`parametrization`), so a formal self-approval **422s**, and our review
  discipline runs on **issue-comment verdicts** validated by Hook 4
  (`validate_pr_review`), not formal reviews. A naive "require 1 approval" rule
  would **deadlock every merge**. Reviewer-count enforcement stays with Hook 4.
- **`required_status_checks` (strict)** — design-system has **unconditional PR CI**
  (`ci.yml` has no `paths:` filter), so the ruleset hard-requires its gate
  **job-name** contexts:

  | Context | Source job |
  |---------|-----------|
  | `ci` | `ci.yml` → `ci` (eslint + prettier format-check + tsc + vite build + vitest) |
  | `validate-package` | `ci.yml` → `validate-package` (pack contents + exports resolution) |

  The `docs.yml` jobs added in W14 — including `precommit-ci-sync` (the
  Pre-commit ⇄ CI sync-drift gate) and the docs/config gates (`markdownlint`,
  `spellcheck`, `linkcheck`, `config-lint`, `actionlint`) — are **`paths:`-
  filtered**, so they do NOT run on every PR and must NOT be hard-required
  (a hard-required context that never reports on a given PR blocks the merge
  indefinitely). Add `{ "context": "precommit-ci-sync" }` (or any docs gate)
  to `ruleset-main.json` only if/when `docs.yml` is changed to run
  unconditionally. **Re-confirm all contexts at apply time** against live
  check-runs — job names can change:
  `gh api repos/<repo>/commits/<default-sha>/check-runs --jq '.check_runs[].name'`.
- **`deletion` + `non_fast_forward`** — no force-push / branch-delete on `main`.
- **`bypass_actors`: Repository-admin (`actor_id: 5`, `bypass_mode: always`)** —
  keeps the orchestrator's `--admin` wave→main wrapup merges and the charter
  single-reviewer / doc-sweep / emergency exceptions working. The GitHub-side
  bypass is mirrored on the operator side by the hook-validated
  `ADMIN_MERGE_EXCEPTION` gate (`validate_pr_ci_status`), which **audits** every
  `--admin` merge to the Annunaki trail — defense in depth: the ruleset covers
  UI/external/batch-loop merges, the hook covers `gh pr merge` and names the
  exceptions.

## How to apply (owner)

```bash
# From a window with NO in-flight default-branch merge (post-wave-wrapup):
.github/branch-protection/apply-ruleset.sh            # create or update
DRY_RUN=1 .github/branch-protection/apply-ruleset.sh  # preview only

# Then read-back-verify the detail (contexts + bypass actor):
gh api repos/noorinalabs/noorinalabs-design-system/rulesets \
  --jq '.[] | select(.name|startswith("Protect main")) | .id'
gh api repos/noorinalabs/noorinalabs-design-system/rulesets/<id>
```
